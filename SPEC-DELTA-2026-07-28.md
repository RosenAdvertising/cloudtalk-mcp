# MCP specification delta: 2025-11-25 to 2026-07-28

Research date: 2026-08-09. Sources are limited to the official MCP
specification, official MCP Python SDK documentation, and the proven
`clio-mcp` fleet migration report supplied for this migration.

## Current target and migration release

This repository targets MCP `2025-11-25` before migration:

- `pyproject.toml` declares `mcp>=1.28.1,<2`, while `uv.lock` resolves MCP
  Python SDK 1.28.1.
- `cloudtalk_mcp/server.py` constructs the v1 `FastMCP` class and relies on the
  SDK's default protocol negotiation.
- The only configured transport is stdio through a parameterless `mcp.run()`.
- The repository has no protocol guard or source test suite. The installed v1
  SDK reports support through `2025-11-25`.

The official changelog says `2026-07-28` follows `2025-11-25`
([spec changelog](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog)).
The fleet's proven implementation release is MCP Python SDK `2.0.0`. The
[official v1-to-v2 migration guide](https://py.sdk.modelcontextprotocol.io/migration/)
documents the `FastMCP` to `MCPServer` rename, revised models, stricter wire
validation, dual-era clients, and transport configuration changes used here.

Verdicts below mean:

- **AFFECTS-US**: this server exposes or relies on the changed surface. The SDK
  may implement the wire behavior, but the migration must still pin, configure,
  or test it.
- **NOT-APPLICABLE**: the feature or transport direction is not implemented.
  This migration does not add it merely because the new revision permits it.

## Protocol negotiation and lifecycle

| Normative change | Verdict | CloudTalk-specific reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Protocol-level sessions and `Mcp-Session-Id` are removed for the modern revision. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#major-changes) | **NOT-APPLICABLE** | The server exposes stdio only and has no MCP session state or Streamable HTTP session-header dependency. Credential state remains process-local downstream CloudTalk Basic Auth. |
| Modern MCP removes `initialize` / `notifications/initialized`; every request carries protocol version and client capabilities in `_meta`, with recommended per-request client/server identity. Unsupported versions use the new typed error. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#major-changes) | **AFFECTS-US** | Stdio must accept modern self-describing requests. SDK v2's dual-era dispatcher must preserve legacy negotiation while supporting the modern path. |
| Servers MUST implement `server/discover` with supported versions, capabilities, and identity. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#major-changes) | **AFFECTS-US** | Discovery is required for every modern server, including stdio servers. |
| All results require `resultType`, ordinarily `"complete"`. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#major-changes) | **AFFECTS-US** | The server returns tool, resource, prompt, and discovery results. |
| Multi Round-Trip Requests replace server-initiated roots, sampling, and elicitation requests. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#major-changes) | **NOT-APPLICABLE** | No CloudTalk tool, resource, or prompt makes a server-to-client request. |
| `ping`, `logging/setLevel`, and `notifications/roots/list_changed` are removed; protocol logging becomes a per-request opt-in. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#major-changes) | **NOT-APPLICABLE** | The server implements none of these features. Application diagnostics use stderr/Python logging, not MCP logging notifications. |

## Transports and notifications

| Normative change | Verdict | CloudTalk-specific reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Streamable HTTP POST requires `Mcp-Method`, plus `Mcp-Name` for named operations; `x-mcp-header` can map selected tool arguments to headers. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#minor-changes) | **NOT-APPLICABLE** | This repository has no HTTP application or Streamable HTTP entry point. The conformance suite still exercises the SDK's raw modern HTTP app so required routing-header behavior cannot regress unnoticed. |
| HTTP GET and resource subscribe/unsubscribe are replaced by `subscriptions/listen`. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#major-changes) | **AFFECTS-US** | The high-level server publishes tools, prompts, and resources and SDK v2 advertises SDK-managed list-change/resource-subscription declarations. The migration preserves those declarations without adding a publisher, event store, or custom subscription bus. |
| SSE resumability and redelivery are removed. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#major-changes) | **NOT-APPLICABLE** | No HTTP/SSE transport or event store is configured. |
| Legacy HTTP+SSE is formally deprecated. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#deprecated) | **NOT-APPLICABLE** | The server exposes stdio only. |

## Capabilities and extensions

| Normative change | Verdict | CloudTalk-specific reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ClientCapabilities` and `ServerCapabilities` gain an `extensions` field. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#minor-changes) | **AFFECTS-US** | `server/discover` exposes capabilities. This migration must prove that no unused extension is advertised. |
| Experimental core tasks move to the `io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks` extension. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#major-changes) | **NOT-APPLICABLE** | The server has no task handlers or task-augmented tools. |
| Roots, Sampling, and Logging are deprecated. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#deprecated) | **NOT-APPLICABLE** | None is declared or used. |
| Sampling `includeContext` values `"thisServer"` and `"allServers"` are deprecated. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#deprecated) | **NOT-APPLICABLE** | Sampling is not used. |

## Tools, resources, prompts, and cache semantics

| Normative change | Verdict | CloudTalk-specific reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tool, prompt, resource, resource-template list results and resource reads require `ttlMs` and `cacheScope`. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#minor-changes) | **AFFECTS-US** | CloudTalk exposes 12 tools, three prompts, three static resources, and an empty template list. Conservative SDK defaults (`ttlMs: 0`, `cacheScope: private`) avoid a new data-retention behavior. |
| `tools/list` SHOULD be deterministic. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#minor-changes) | **AFFECTS-US** | Decorator registration order is stable and must be regression-tested across repeated listings. |
| Tool schemas allow all JSON Schema 2020-12 keywords; `structuredContent` may be any JSON value, with defined `$ref` and composition limits. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#minor-changes) | **AFFECTS-US** | SDK v2 owns schema generation and validation. Existing dictionary tool results and generated object schemas must remain valid. |
| Resource-not-found changes from `-32002` to JSON-RPC Invalid Params `-32602`. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#minor-changes) | **AFFECTS-US** | Unknown `cloudtalk://` resources must use the revised code. |
| URL elicitation removes its completion notification and `elicitationId`; MRTR retries use application `requestState`. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#minor-changes) | **NOT-APPLICABLE** | The server performs no elicitation. |
| Generated schema numeric `minimum`, `maximum`, and `default` types are corrected. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#other-schema-changes) | **NOT-APPLICABLE** | The repository does not vendor or directly validate against the generated MCP meta-schema. SDK v2 absorbs the correction. |

## Authorization and security

| Normative change | Verdict | CloudTalk-specific reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authorization servers SHOULD return RFC 9207 `iss`; MCP clients validate it before code redemption. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#minor-changes) | **NOT-APPLICABLE** | This stdio server is neither an MCP authorization server nor an MCP OAuth client. Its downstream CloudTalk API key pair is unrelated to MCP OAuth. |
| Dynamic Client Registration clients must send an appropriate `application_type`. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#minor-changes) | **NOT-APPLICABLE** | No MCP client is dynamically registered. |
| Persisted MCP client credentials must be bound to their authorization-server issuer. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#minor-changes) | **NOT-APPLICABLE** | The repository stores downstream CloudTalk API credentials, not MCP OAuth client registrations. |
| Dynamic Client Registration is deprecated in favor of Client ID Metadata Documents. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#deprecated) | **NOT-APPLICABLE** | The server neither hosts DCR nor acts as a dynamically registered MCP client. |

## Errors, metadata, and observability

| Normative change | Verdict | CloudTalk-specific reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MCP reserves `-32020..-32099`; HeaderMismatch, MissingRequiredClientCapability, and UnsupportedProtocolVersion become `-32020`, `-32021`, and `-32022`; unknown methods use `-32601`. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#minor-changes) | **AFFECTS-US** | Unsupported-version and unknown-method behavior is reachable over stdio and must be tested. HTTP-only header mismatch is also covered through the SDK app; no optional client capability is introduced solely to trigger `-32021`. |
| `_meta` formally carries W3C trace-context keys. [Source](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog#minor-changes) | **NOT-APPLICABLE** | The server has no MCP trace-context integration. The migration does not add an observability feature. |

Governance and SEP workflow changes impose no runtime requirement and are not
separately classified. The feature lifecycle is respected by not adopting
deprecated Roots, Sampling, Logging, HTTP+SSE, or DCR.
