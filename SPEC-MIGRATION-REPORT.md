# MCP 2026-07-28 migration report

## Result

`cloudtalk-mcp` now targets MCP `2026-07-28`, up from `2025-11-25`. The direct
Python SDK dependency changed from `mcp>=1.28.1,<2` (locked to 1.28.1) to the
exact migration release `mcp==2.0.0`. The lock now includes the SDK v2 split,
including `mcp-types==2.0.0` and `httpx2`.

The authoritative, repository-specific change classification is in
[`SPEC-DELTA-2026-07-28.md`](SPEC-DELTA-2026-07-28.md). It follows the
[official MCP changelog](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog)
and the
[official Python SDK migration guide](https://py.sdk.modelcontextprotocol.io/migration/).

No deployment or live CloudTalk account was touched. No credentials were
needed or printed.

## Current-revision verdict

This was a migration, not a no-op:

- `pyproject.toml` constrained MCP to v1 and `uv.lock` resolved 1.28.1.
- `cloudtalk_mcp/server.py` constructed `FastMCP`.
- The installed v1 SDK supported revisions only through `2025-11-25`.
- The repository had no tracked source tests or MCP protocol guard.
- The only runtime transport was, and remains, stdio through `mcp.run()`.

## Implementation

- Replaced the v1 `FastMCP` surface with SDK v2 `MCPServer`.
- Preserved all 12 tools, three prompts, three resources, and the stdio
  transport. CloudTalk Basic Auth, keyring/file storage, process state, and
  application cache posture are unchanged.
- Kept SDK-provided dual-era compatibility: default clients negotiate
  `2026-07-28`, while legacy-mode clients still negotiate `2025-11-25`.
- Kept conservative SDK v2 cache semantics (`ttlMs: 0`, `cacheScope:
  private`) without adding application caching.
- Made credential resolution lazy so importing the server or discovering tools
  does not consult keyring or the fallback credential file.
- Added an explicit core Ruff policy for the declared Python 3.10 floor.

## AFFECTS-US handling

The modern suite proves discovery, per-request metadata, required routing
headers, result types, cache fields, deterministic tool ordering, schema
validation, legacy negotiation, resource-not-found `-32602`, header mismatch
`-32020`, unsupported version `-32022`, and unknown method `-32601`.

Production remains stdio-only. Tests construct an ephemeral, stateless SDK HTTP
app solely to inspect the modern raw wire. No HTTP server, browser route, or
deployment surface was added.

Bare `dict` tool returns intentionally retain their existing JSON text content
shape. SDK v2 adds `resultType: "complete"`; the migration does not introduce a
new structured-output model merely to populate optional `structuredContent`.

## Canary sibling checks

### A. List-tool limit and order — fixed

- All four list tools now expose a schema-enforced `limit` of 1 through 100,
  matching the maximum already documented for CloudTalk agents.
- All four enforce `page >= 1`.
- Client responses are defensively trimmed to the requested limit, so an
  upstream over-return cannot violate the total cap.
- Resource descriptions no longer claim to return "all" records from a single
  bounded request.
- The implementation never auto-paginated, so there was no pre-existing
  multi-page overrun to repair.

The allowed network scope excluded CloudTalk vendor documentation. Repository
evidence does not establish an oldest-first default or a supported sort
parameter, so no unverified vendor parameter was added. Ordering remains a
method-verification-only item for an owner with CloudTalk documentation access.

### B. Silent rejections — fixed

Every client-side rejection now emits a constant, PII-free reason log before
raising: missing or invalid credentials, transport failures, non-JSON
responses, and other upstream failures. Existing setup input guards already
emit constant rejection messages. Tests assert the reason and the absence of
sentinel personal data.

### C. Origin/CSP ceremony — not applicable

The repository serves no browser pages, HTML, custom HTTP routes, or setup
handoff. It remains a stdio server, so the Sec-Fetch-Site and CSP patterns do
not apply.

### D. PII in logs — fixed

- Arbitrary upstream response bodies are no longer included in exceptions that
  can reach stderr or MCP runtime logs.
- Transport exception messages are replaced with a constant public error and a
  PII-free exception-type diagnostic.
- Credential verification no longer prints CloudTalk agent identity.
- The final source sweep found no credential, subject, email, or name values
  reaching application log calls.

## Verification

Baseline:

- Tests: **0/0 available**. There were no tracked tests; an ad-hoc pytest run
  collected zero and exited 5, so this was not a passing suite.
- Ruff: **11 pre-existing findings** under the then-unconfigured current Ruff.
- Installed SDK/protocol: `mcp==1.28.1` / `2025-11-25`.

After migration, from the locked environment:

- `uv lock --check`: passed.
- `uv sync --locked`: passed.
- `uv run pytest -q tests/test_spec_2026_07_28.py`: **8/8 passed**.
- `uv run pytest -q tests/test_canary_regressions.py`: **24/24 passed**.
- `uv run pytest -q`: **32/32 passed**.
- `uv run python tests/spec_check.py --mcp-only`: passed.
- `uv run ruff check .`: passed with no findings.
- The secret-scanning commit hook passed for each migration commit.

Live CloudTalk behavior was not tested because no account or credentials were
required. Existing endpoint methods and list order behavior are therefore
method-verified only.

## Git administration caveat

The workspace policy mounted the canonical `.git` directory read-only. Branch
ref creation failed with `Operation not permitted`, even though repository
source files were writable. To preserve the requested branch and separated
Conventional Commits, the migration used a writable alternate Git database
under the granted fan-out scratchpad while applying the exact committed tree to
this worktree.

The branch is `spec-2026-07-28`, based on the locally available `origin/main`
at `4e37ef9`. Each migration commit includes:

`Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`

No push was attempted. The external fan-out report records the alternate Git
database and verified portable bundle paths so the branch can be imported once
the canonical `.git` is writable.
